# Allison's Portfolio
The website is inspired by Unpacking, the game. With a digital room concept, I imported hand-drawn assets to make it feel like home. The front-end development is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built on a Vite + React framework, I deployed the website on Vercel which tracks my GitHub commits. The styling still needs to be updated to dynamically work with different screen sizes and I need to add more content to the book overlay on the table. Feel free to check it out and pet my dog Duoduo! If there are any bugs other than styling, please let me know!

```shell
$ vercel
```
